# Introduction to Full Stack Development

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches you how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. By the end of this course, you will have a firm foundation on aspects of computer programming while creating applications. This course is very project and homework heavy. You will do most of your learning by doing.

## General Information of the Course

This course is basically to give you an understanding of how computer software works and how applications are built. After getting your computer set up for development, you will be building web pages and applications. After some time, we will be developing mobile applications. You will learn how to build the front and back ends of an application. Along the way, you will be learning the general principles of programming that will translate to any specialty of programming (like robotics, ethical hacking, building your own startup, etc). You will also have knowledge of how the computers work. Finally, we will dive into the knowledge of how to do well in software engineering interviews.

This course doesn't strictly follow a textbook. The course roughly aligns itself with FreeCodeCamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

The tech stack this course covers is the MERN stack, MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS. We will learn about these technologies in this course.

## Office Hours

I will be hosting office hours on a regular basis where you can come to be to get help on your assignments and projects as well to let you pick my brain. Keep in mind I also work a full time job. I will do what I can to make myself available to you. You may also ping me in the class chat.

Office hours: TBD

## Required Materials

The only required material for this class is a laptop and constant internet access. The following operating systems: Windows 10 (any edition), Mac OS X (Apple) and Linux. **Smartphones and tablets do not fulfill this requirement!** If you need help in obtaining a laptop for this class or need suggestions for a laptop, please see me ASAP!!!

Other than that, the learning materials are going to be free provided by the internet. :)

## Learning Outcomes:

By the end of the course, you should have a good understanding of the following:

* HTML5 and CSS 3
* JavaScript (ES5 and ES6) Programming
* ReactJS
* React Native
* ExpressJS
* NodeJS
* Databases (Structured and Unstructured)
* APIs
* Async Operations
* Data Structures and Algorithm
* Time and Complexity Analysis
* How Computers Work
* How the internet works
* Binary System
* HTTP Protocols
* Version Control (Git)
* Effective Googling
* Referencing material properly
* Anything else I see fit :)

## Class Rules

***Don't be a jerk.*** If you need to use the restroom, just use it. If you're late, come into the class quietly. Show your everyone around you respect and you'll be fine. Really, the only rule I have is you're not allowed to be a jerk.

Instances of you being a jerk will be punished harshly.

## Quizzes

Usually at the beginning of each class, I will have a quiz that is based on the last lesson(s) and homework assignments. This is merely to check for understanding. The quizzed should take no longer than 20 minutes to do.

## Homework Policy

Like playing soccer, learning to play video games, programming is a skill that must be practiced consistently. You cannot become a master programming by just coming to the one lecture a week for a couple hours. **Therefore, significant amounts of homework will be given very week. Expect to put about 20 hours a week on the assignments.** And don't worry, you will struggle on the homework. Struggling is very normal while learning and even while on the job. We are here to help.

Homework will vary from week to week. They can vary from problem sets to the weekly projects that draw from lessons. You are expected to spend significant time on the homework and that your work is yours. Homework will usually be submitted through Github.

*Homework is due by the beginning of the next Thursday of class unless I state otherwise or you were granted an extension. If you need an extension, please let me know ASAP, not at the last minute! We can work something out.*

## Academic Honesty Policy

The tl;dr version is ***be reasonable***. I expect your work to be your work and your understanding to be yours. I understand and even expect that you will be interacting with your fellow classmates and that you will be referencing material (official documentation or not) to get your assignments done. That is perfectly fine and within the norm of the industry. Chances are that the problem you are struggling has been solved before.

That being said, the line that is drawn is ***plagiarism***. You should not be claiming code that you did not write as yours. If you do use a code snippet, ***please*** credit the person. You may do so by acknowledging them with the code comments or just even linking in the comments where you got it from on the relevant code sections. I will not take away points if you use a code snippet if you give credit.

When I catch (notice I didn't say *if*) someone being "***unreasonable***", there will be serious negative repercussions.

Remember, your work is to be your work and your understanding to be your understanding. Long story short, ***be reasonable*** and you will be alright.

## Hackathon

There will be a good chance that this class will be hosting a Hackathon. A Hackathon is basically where you will be creating a project, with a group, for 24-48 hours (usually without sleep :)) straight. More information will be provided well in advanced of this event.

## Big Projects

The big projects are opportunities to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon the course’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit subject to the staff’s approval. You may implement your project in any language(s) as long as the staff approves. You are welcome to utilize any infrastructure, provided the staff ultimately has access to any hardware and software that your project requires. All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact campus, or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.

You will be allowed to work up into groups of four to work on the big projects. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that group’s project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a group’s project be more typical one-person project. A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course’s problem sets. You are welcome to solicit advice from others, so long as you respect academic honesty.

If you need ideas of a "big project", you are more than welcome to talk to me about it.

Tentative due dates for big projects: ***December 11th, 2019*** and ***June 4th, 2020***.
